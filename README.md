# Miekeuyt Professional Website

This is the source code for my professional website. The site showcases my skills as a software engineer, includes testimonials, and details my work experience.

## Tech Stack

The website is built with Vue 3 and TypeScript, and is optimized for desktop viewing. It also uses [Masonryjs](https://masonry.desandro.com).

## Development

This project was developed over a course of 4 days. It is not intended for local development but you're welcome to explore the code to understand its structure and functionalities.

## Deployment

The website is hosted on AWS using services like S3 for storage, Route53 for DNS management, and CloudFront for content delivery. The deployment process involves building the project for production (`npm run build`) and uploading the resulting `dist` directory to the AWS S3 hosting service.
